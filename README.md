# LAW result file app

## Description
When you've completed an SAP license audit, this project helps you to understand the content of the result file of the SAP License Administration Workbench (LAW). You can run this sample code either online in the SAP ONE Support Launchpad (https://zglacelx-supportportal.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/, S-user required) or download and run it locally in your own UI5 environment.

## Requirements
To run the app, you need a HTTP webserver, UI5 (either SAP UI5 or openUI5 from https://openui5.org/) and a copy of this sample code.

## Download and Installation
There are many ways to run this sample code. We describe three options in more details here:

### Option 1: Run the app in your own SAP WebIDE
This option is the easiest, as you just have to clone the sample code into your workspace. 

Step 1: Clone GitHub repository
Open your WebIDE and right-click your workspace. Select the option “Clone Repository”.

Enter the URL https://github.com/SAP-samples/law-result-file.git and press clone.

You may be asked for user authentication on GitHub. If the Git Ignore System Files dialog pops up, press “Commit and Push”. A clone completed confirmation should show up.

Step 2: Start the app
After the repository is cloned, open the project folder and the webapp subfolder. 
Right-Click the file index.html file in there and choose Run > Run index.html

### Option 2: Download the app and run it on a HTTP web server (example: in Visual Studio Code)
For this option, you need a copy of Visual Studio Code, the sample code and UI5.
