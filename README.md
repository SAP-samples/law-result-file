# LAW result file app

## When you've completed an SAP license audit, this project helps you to understand the content of the result file of the SAP License Administration Workbench (LAW). You can run this sample code either online in the SAP ONE Support Launchpad (https://zglacelx-supportportal.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/, S-user required) or download it and run it locally in your own UI5 environment.
